# Advanced: Building the CUDA graph conditional fatbin

The `qd.graph.do_while` feature uses a tiny CUDA kernel that calls `cudaGraphSetConditional` (a device-side function from NVIDIA's `libcudadevrt.a`) to control CUDA graph conditional while nodes. These conditional nodes require SM 9.0+ (Hopper or later); on older GPUs, `qd.graph.do_while` falls back to a host-side loop automatically.

There are three distinct phases:

1. **Fatbin generation** (rare, manual) — A developer runs `scripts/build_condition_kernel_fatbin.py` (and the sibling `build_checkpoint_gate_fatbin.py` / `build_checkpoint_yield_check_fatbin.py`), which compiles the kernel and device-links it with `libcudadevrt.a` to resolve `cudaGraphSetConditional`. Each script emits **one fatbin per build toolkit** (see Prerequisites), all committed to git in a single C header. Requires the CUDA toolkits listed below.
2. **Quadrants build** (CI / developers) — The C header is `#include`d as plain byte arrays. No CUDA toolkit needed.
3. **Runtime** (end users) — The fatbins are loaded via `cuModuleLoadData`. No CUDA toolkit needed.

This page documents phase 1: regenerating the pre-built fatbins.

## When to regenerate

You only need to regenerate the fatbin if:

- The condition kernel source (`quadrants/runtime/cuda/graph_do_while_cond.cu`) changes.
- You need to add support for a new SM architecture.

## Prerequisites

Each SM architecture is compiled with the oldest suitable CUDA toolkit, and the per-toolkit results are bundled into one header. This is what keeps each cubin loadable on the widest range of drivers: a SASS cubin can only be loaded by a driver whose CUDA version is `>=` the toolkit that produced it, so building e.g. sm_120 (RTX 5090) with a newer toolkit than necessary would make it reject older drivers with `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE`. The per-arch toolkit requirement lives in the `SM_TOOLKIT` mapping in `scripts/_fatbin_common.py`, where each SM maps to a version spec — `==X.Y` (exact) or `>=X.Y` (minimum):

- **`==12.8` (matched exactly)** — every architecture except sm_110 (pre-Hopper sm_60 / sm_70 / sm_80, Hopper sm_90, Blackwell sm_100 / sm_120). 12.8 is the oldest toolkit that covers all shipping Blackwell parts, and is the wide-compatibility anchor, so it is matched exactly rather than "or newer".
- **`>=13.0`** — sm_110 (Thor) only; earlier toolkits fail with `Unsupported gpu architecture 'compute_110'`. This is a minimum: the oldest available toolkit `>=` 13.0 is used (e.g. 13.1 is fine). There is no old-driver constraint pulling it lower, since Thor is new hardware.

**All** required toolkits must be installed; the scripts raise `MissingToolkitError` (listing what is missing and what was discovered) before compiling anything if any is absent. Toolkits are auto-discovered from `/usr/local/cuda-*/bin/nvcc`, `nvcc` on `PATH`, and `CUDA_HOME` / `CUDA_PATH`. To point at toolkits in non-standard locations, set `QUADRANTS_NVCC_CANDIDATES` to an `os.pathsep`-separated list of nvcc binaries and/or CUDA root directories, e.g.:

```bash
export QUADRANTS_NVCC_CANDIDATES=/opt/cuda-12.8:/opt/cuda-13.1/bin/nvcc
```

## Regenerating

Run the script from the repo root:

```bash
python scripts/build_condition_kernel_fatbin.py
```

This will, for each build toolkit:

1. Compile `quadrants/runtime/cuda/graph_do_while_cond.cu` with relocatable device code for that toolkit's target SM architectures.
2. Device-link the result with `libcudadevrt.a` to resolve the `cudaGraphSetConditional` extern.

It then writes all the per-toolkit fatbins as C byte arrays (plus a small lookup table) to `quadrants/runtime/cuda/graph_do_while_cond_fatbin.h`.

Regenerate the checkpoint kernels the same way with `scripts/build_checkpoint_gate_fatbin.py` and `scripts/build_checkpoint_yield_check_fatbin.py`. The generator emits a compact byte-array layout; run `pre-commit run -a` (clang-format) on the regenerated headers so they match the committed formatting before committing them. Quadrants must be rebuilt to pick up the new fatbins.

## Verifying the committed fatbins

`tests/python/test_fatbin_arch_coverage.py` holds an explicit, hand-maintained `EXPECTED_LAYOUT` for each committed `*_fatbin.h` — the architectures and the CUDA toolkit expected in every blob (e.g. `sm_90 / sm_100 / sm_120` built with CUDA 12.8 in blob 0 and `sm_110` built with CUDA 13.0+ in blob 1 for the condition kernel). It deliberately does *not* re-derive this from `scripts/_fatbin_common.py`, so a regression in the `SM_TOOLKIT` mapping is caught rather than silently baked into a new header. For every embedded cubin it checks both the SASS arch and the build toolkit that `cuobjdump` reports, so it directly asserts the load-bearing fact behind #2942: the sm_120 (RTX 5090) cubin is built with the wide-compatibility CUDA 12.8, not a newer toolkit that would reintroduce `CUDA_ERROR_INVALID_IMAGE` on 570-series drivers. It also drift-guards each `SM_VERSIONS` list against the arch set actually baked into the checked-in header.

The test shells out to `cuobjdump`, so it is skipped unless `cuobjdump` is on `PATH`; the toolkit providing it must also be at least as new as the newest one used to build the fatbins (CUDA 13.0+, for sm_110), otherwise the affected header is skipped rather than failed. Run it after regenerating:

```bash
# Make a recent CUDA toolkit's cuobjdump visible on PATH, e.g.:
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
python -m pytest tests/python/test_fatbin_arch_coverage.py -v
```

## Adding a new SM architecture

Add the new SM version number to the `SM_VERSIONS` list in the relevant `scripts/build_*_fatbin.py`, and add an entry for it to `SM_TOOLKIT` in `scripts/_fatbin_common.py`: use `"==X.Y"` to pin it to an exact toolkit (the oldest one that covers it, as for the `==12.8` archs) or `">=X.Y"` for a minimum (as done for `110: ">=13.0"`). Then make sure a matching toolkit is installed and regenerate. (Every SM in `SM_VERSIONS` must have an `SM_TOOLKIT` entry, or the scripts raise `KeyError`.)

## How it's used at runtime

`GraphManager::ensure_condition_kernel_loaded()` in `quadrants/runtime/cuda/graph_manager.cpp` loads the fatbins via `GraphManager::load_first_matching_fatbin()`, which tries each bundled per-toolkit fatbin with `cuModuleLoadData` and keeps the first that loads (a device only loads the fatbin containing SASS for its SM). If none contain SASS for the current GPU's SM architecture, loading fails with a clear error pointing to the relevant regeneration script. The checkpoint kernels load the same way from `graph_manager_checkpoint.cpp`.

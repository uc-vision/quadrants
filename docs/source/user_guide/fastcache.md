# Fastcache

## What it is

Fastcache reduces the time it takes to load cached kernels when a new Python process starts.

The standard [offline cache](init_options.md#offline_cache) already persists compiled kernels to disk. However, loading a cached kernel still requires re-reading and re-analyzing the Python kernel source (parsing it and preparing it for the compiler) before the saved artifact can be matched and reused, which takes non-negligible time. For applications with many kernels this parsing overhead alone can take several seconds.

Fastcache bypasses that parsing and analysis work. It computes a cheap cache key from the kernel source text, argument types, and compiler config, and uses it to load the compiled artifact directly.

On a Genesis simulator benchmark (`single_franka_envs.py`, Ubuntu 24.04, NVIDIA 5090):

| Configuration | Process-start kernel load time |
|---|---|
| Other caches (no fastcache) | 4.6 s |
| + fastcache | 0.3 s |

## How to use it

### Enabling fastcache on a kernel

Fastcache requires the kernel to be *pure*: all data it operates on must be passed as explicit parameters, with nothing captured from the enclosing Python scope (see [Constraints](#constraints) below). Because not all kernels satisfy this, fastcache is opt-in - you assert purity by adding `fastcache=True` to the `@qd.kernel` decorator:

```python
import quadrants as qd

@qd.kernel(fastcache=True)
def my_kernel(a: qd.types.NDArray[qd.f32, 1], b: qd.types.NDArray[qd.f32, 1]) -> None:
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):
        b[i] = a[i] * 2.0
```

That's it. On the first call, the kernel compiles normally and the fastcache entry is written to disk. When the next Python process starts, the cached artifact is loaded directly.

### Runtime configuration

Fastcache requires the offline cache to be enabled (which it is by default). Two `qd.init` options are relevant:

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `src_ll_cache` | `True` | Master switch for fastcache. Set to `False` to disable it globally. |
| `print_non_pure` | `False` | When `True`, prints the name of every kernel at call time that is *not* marked `fastcache=True`. Useful for finding kernels you forgot to annotate. |

```python
qd.init(arch=qd.gpu)
# Fastcache is on by default. To disable:
# qd.init(arch=qd.gpu, src_ll_cache=False)

# To find un-annotated kernels:
# qd.init(arch=qd.gpu, print_non_pure=True)
```

## Constraints

A kernel is eligible for fastcache only if all of the following hold:

### 1. All data flows through parameters

The kernel must receive every piece of data it operates on as an explicit parameter. It must **not** capture variables from the enclosing Python scope (closures over ndarrays, mutable globals, or any other external state). This is the core "purity" constraint - the compiled kernel's behavior must be fully determined by its arguments.

```python
a = qd.ndarray(qd.f32, (10,))

# Not eligible: captures `a` from enclosing scope
@qd.kernel(fastcache=True)
def bad_kernel() -> None:
    for i in range(10):
        a[i] = 0.0  # raises QuadrantsCompilationError

# Eligible: `a` is passed as a parameter
@qd.kernel(fastcache=True)
def good_kernel(a: qd.types.NDArray[qd.f32, 1]) -> None:
    for i in range(a.shape[0]):
        a[i] = 0.0
```

Sub-functions called by the kernel are also checked - they must not capture external state either.

Reaching data through the members of a [`@qd.data_oriented`](compound_types.md#qddata_oriented) parameter is **not** capture, even though the Python source (e.g. `self.x` inside a data-oriented method) reads like member access rather than a parameter. The object is itself an explicit kernel parameter, and the compiler resolves each accessed member at compile time - either passing it as a real kernel argument (e.g. a `qd.ndarray` member) or compiling it into the kernel (e.g. a primitive or `qd.field` member); see [Compound-type cache keying](#compound-type-cache-keying) for exactly how each member kind is treated and keyed. Either way the member is parameter-derived, not a free variable captured from the enclosing Python scope, which is what the purity check forbids.

The same holds for a [`dataclasses.dataclass`](compound_types.md#dataclassesdataclass) passed as a typed parameter: the compiler flattens each declared field into its own kernel parameter, so `params.dt` inside the kernel is a parameter access, not capture. By default a primitive field is passed as a runtime scalar argument - only its type enters the fastcache key, not its value (annotate the field with `FIELD_METADATA_CACHE_VALUE` to bake the value in instead) - and an ndarray field becomes a runtime external tensor. See [Compound-type cache keying](#compound-type-cache-keying) for the full keying rules.

**Exemptions:** The following may be accessed from the enclosing scope without violating purity:

| Allowed capture | Why |
|---|---|
| `enum.Enum` values (e.g. `MyEnum.VALUE`) | Named constants that are assumed not to vary between process runs. |
| `math` / `numpy` constants (e.g. `math.pi`) | Assumed stable across process runs. |
| Quadrants module attributes (e.g. `qd.simt.Tile16x16.SIZE`) | Part of the compiler's own API; assumed consistent with the Quadrants version hash. |

Other named constants (non-enum, non-module) captured from scope will raise a `QuadrantsCompilationError`, except for `UPPERCASE` names which emit a warning instead.

Wrapping a captured global in `qd.static(...)` does **not** exempt it from this check. `qd.static` only controls compile-time evaluation; it does not put the value into the cache key, so a `qd.static`-wrapped global is still flagged - though during the current transition period this emits a warning rather than raising. To use such a constant in a fastcache kernel, pass it as a parameter (template primitive, [`@qd.data_oriented`](compound_types.md#qddata_oriented) member, or dataclass field) or make it one of the allowed captures above.

### 2. Supported parameter types

Fastcache supports the following parameter types:

| Type | Supported | Cache key includes |
|---|---|---|
| `qd.types.NDArray` (scalar, vector, matrix) | Yes | dtype, ndim, layout |
| `torch.Tensor` | Yes | dtype, ndim |
| `numpy.ndarray` | Yes | dtype, ndim |
| [`dataclasses.dataclass`](compound_types.md#dataclassesdataclass) | Yes | member types recursively; member values if annotated with `FIELD_METADATA_CACHE_VALUE` (see [Appendix - compound-type cache keying](#compound-type-cache-keying)) |
| [`@qd.data_oriented`](compound_types.md#qddata_oriented) objects | Yes | member types recursively; primitive member types and values baked into kernel, unless declared `template_primitives=False`, in which case primitive members contribute their *type* only (see [Appendix - compound-type cache keying](#compound-type-cache-keying)) |
| `qd.Template` primitives (int, float, bool) | Yes | type and value (baked into kernel) |
| Non-template primitives (int, float, bool) | Yes | type only |
| `enum.Enum` | Yes | name and value |
| `qd.field` / [`ScalarField`](matrix_vector.md#vector-and-matrix-fields) / [`MatrixField`](matrix_vector.md#vector-and-matrix-fields) | **No** | - |

If any parameter is of an unsupported type, fastcache is disabled for that call and the kernel falls back to normal compilation. For `qd.field` / [`ScalarField`](matrix_vector.md#vector-and-matrix-fields) / [`MatrixField`](matrix_vector.md#vector-and-matrix-fields) arriving through a [qd.Tensor](tensor.md)-annotated parameter, this is silent - no warning is emitted. For other unsupported types, a warning is logged at the `warn` level identifying the offending parameter.

### 3. Source code must be available

Fastcache hashes the source code of the kernel and all sub-functions it calls. If the source file cannot be read at runtime (e.g. the kernel is defined in a frozen/compiled module, or the file has been deleted), fastcache cannot validate the cache and will fall back to normal compilation.

## Cache keying

Each compiled artifact is stored under a key derived from all of the following:

- The **Quadrants version** (`quadrants.__version__`).
- The **source code** of the kernel function or any `@qd.func` it calls.
- The **argument types** (e.g. switching from `f32` to `f64`, or changing ndarray dimensionality).
- The **compiler configuration** (e.g. `arch`, `debug`, `opt_level`, `fast_math`).
- **Template parameter values** (since they are baked into the compiled kernel).

When any of these change, the resulting key is different, so a new compilation occurs and a new entry is stored. Previous entries remain on disk - multiple cached versions coexist. You do not need to manually clear the cache when making code changes - the hash mismatch causes a transparent recompilation.

## Advanced

### Diagnostics

You can inspect whether fastcache was used for a specific kernel via the `src_ll_cache_observations` attribute on the kernel's primal:

```python
@qd.kernel(fastcache=True)
def my_kernel(x: qd.types.NDArray[qd.f32, 1]) -> None:
    for i in range(x.shape[0]):
        x[i] += 1.0

my_kernel(some_array)

obs = my_kernel._primal.src_ll_cache_observations
print(obs.cache_key_generated)  # True if the cache key was computed
print(obs.cache_validated)      # True if a cached entry was found and source hashes matched
print(obs.cache_loaded)         # True if the compiled kernel was loaded from cache
print(obs.cache_stored)         # True if the compiled kernel was stored to cache
```

On the first run you'll see `cache_stored=True` but `cache_loaded=False`. On the second run (after `qd.init`), `cache_loaded=True`.

### Why `qd.field` disables fastcache

Fields are allocated contiguously in a single global memory region, one after another. A compiled kernel bakes in the memory bindings (offsets into that region) of the fields it accesses. Because all fields share one layout, redimensioning *any* field - including one completely unrelated to the fields this kernel touches - shifts the offsets of every field allocated after it, so the bindings baked into an already-compiled kernel no longer point at the right memory.

Fastcache reuses a compiled kernel across separate Python processes, keyed only on the kernel source, argument types, and compiler config. That key cannot capture the global field layout, which depends on the sizes and allocation order of *all* fields created in the program - state that is external to this kernel and can differ from run to run. So a kernel loaded from cache in a later process could carry field bindings that no longer match the current layout, silently reading or writing the wrong memory.

For this reason a kernel that touches any `qd.field` - directly, or through a `@qd.data_oriented` or other compound-type member - can never use fastcache: fastcache is disabled for that call and the kernel falls back to normal compilation. If you need fastcache, use `qd.ndarray` instead: an ndarray is passed as a runtime parameter (a data pointer bound at launch), so no field-layout state is baked into the kernel.

## Appendix

### Compound-type cache keying

As part of generating the fastcache cache key, fastcache hashes each kernel parameter. Compound types are hashed recursively. The headline rules:

**`@qd.data_oriented`:** each attribute in `vars(obj)` is hashed. For each child:

- `qd.ndarray` member - `(dtype, ndim, layout)` is included in the cache key. Element values are not.
- Primitive (`int` / `float` / `bool` / `enum.Enum`) member - value is baked into the kernel (same semantics as a `qd.Template` primitive). Two instances of the same class with different primitive member values get different cache entries. **Exception:** if the class is declared `@qd.data_oriented(template_primitives=False)`, primitive members are lifted to runtime scalar args rather than baked, so only their *type* contributes to the cache key - two instances with different primitive values share one cache entry and changing a value does not recompile.
- Nested `@qd.data_oriented` member - recurses.
- Nested `dataclasses.dataclass` member - recurses (with the dataclass rules below).
- `qd.field` member - fastcache is disabled for the entire kernel call. The kernel still runs via normal compilation; a warn-level log line is emitted. See [Why `qd.field` disables fastcache](#why-qdfield-disables-fastcache) for the reason.

**`dataclasses.dataclass`:** each declared member is hashed. For each member, only the *type* is included in the cache key by default - **not** the value. To include a member's value, annotate it:

```python
import dataclasses
from quadrants.lang._fast_caching import FIELD_METADATA_CACHE_VALUE

@dataclasses.dataclass
class SimConfig:
    num_layers: int = dataclasses.field(metadata={FIELD_METADATA_CACHE_VALUE: True})
    dt: float = dataclasses.field(metadata={FIELD_METADATA_CACHE_VALUE: True})
```

This is necessary whenever a member's *value* is baked into a compiled kernel, in some way, rather than just its type. Typically this is by using [@qd.static](static.md), within the kernel.

Note the asymmetry: `@qd.data_oriented` primitive member values are baked into the kernel automatically (same semantics as `qd.Template`); `dataclasses.dataclass` members contribute only their *type* to the cache key unless you opt in per-member.

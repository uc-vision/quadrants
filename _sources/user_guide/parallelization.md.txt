# Parallelization

Each top-level for-loop will be parallelized, within a kernel. Under the hood, each top-level for-loop will be launched as a separate GPU kernel.

A top-level for-loop can be encapsulated in one or more of the following, and still be parallelized:
- `if` statements where the conditional is [`qd.static`](static.md)
- inline functions (`@qd.func`)

Note that adding a non-static `if` over the top of a for-loop will lead to the for-loop NOT being parallelized.

## Multi-dimensional parallelization with qd.ndrange

Since only top-level for loops are parallelized, nested for loops will run sequentially on each thread. To parallelize over multiple dimensions, use `qd.ndrange()` to flatten them into a single top-level loop:

```python
@qd.kernel
def process_image(image: qd.Template) -> None:
    for row, col, channel in qd.ndrange(height, width, 3):
        image[row, col, channel] = row + col
```

This launches `height * width * 3` threads in parallel, rather than only parallelizing the outer loop.

### Syntax

Each argument to `qd.ndrange` is either:
- an integer `n`, meaning `range(0, n)`
- a tuple `(start, end)`, meaning `range(start, end)`

```python
@qd.kernel
def compute(a: qd.Template) -> None:
    for i, j in qd.ndrange((2, 10), 5):
        a[i, j] = i * 10 + j
    # i ranges over 2..9, j ranges over 0..4
```

### qd.grouped with qd.ndrange

`qd.grouped()` packs the loop indices into a single vector, which is useful for writing dimension-independent code:

```python
@qd.kernel
def fill(a: qd.Template) -> None:
    for I in qd.grouped(qd.ndrange(4, 8, 16)):
        a[I] = I[0] + I[1] + I[2]
```

`I` is a `qd.Vector` with one element per dimension.

### Controlling iteration order with `axes=`

By default, `qd.ndrange(d0, d1, ..., dN-1)` makes the **last argument the innermost (fastest-varying) axis** in the flat parallel loop: adjacent flat threads differ in the last index. The `axes=` keyword lets you choose a different iteration-nesting order. It's a tuple of `int` listing the **canonical axis index at each successive iteration-nesting level, outermost first**, and must be a permutation of `range(N)` where `N` is the number of arguments to `qd.ndrange`:

```python
@qd.kernel
def k():
    # axis 1 is outermost (slowest-varying), axis 0 is innermost (fastest-varying)
    for i, j in qd.ndrange(M, N, axes=(1, 0)):
        ...
```

The yielded loop variables (`i`, `j`, ...) are still bound to canonical axes 0, 1, ... — only the visit order changes. `axes=None` (the default) and the identity permutation `(0, 1, ..., N-1)` are equivalent and reproduce the default last-argument-innermost order. Mismatched length and non-permutation values are rejected up front with `qd.QuadrantsSyntaxError`; non-integer entries with `qd.QuadrantsTypeError`.

`axes=` is independent of what's in the loop body: it controls the iteration order regardless of whether the body touches a `qd.field`, a `qd.ndarray`, a `qd.tensor`, a `qd.Vector` / `qd.Matrix` variant, or no tensor at all.

`axes=` is supported by both the plain and `qd.grouped` forms:

```python
for i, j in qd.ndrange(M, N, axes=(1, 0)):
    ...
for I in qd.grouped(qd.ndrange(M, N, axes=(1, 0))):
    # I[0] is still the canonical axis-0 index, regardless of axes
    ...
```

## Does GPU kernel launch latency matter?

Kernel launch can be done in parallel while the previously launched kernel is still running. This means that if the previously launched kernel takes longer to run than the launch time for the new kernel, then the kernel launch latency will be perfectly hidden.

It's important to try to make sure that the work done by each kernel is sufficient to hide the kernel launch latency, otherwise the launch latency will be a bottleneck to maximum performance.

If kernel launch latency is a bottleneck, then you can look into:
- getting each kernel to do more work, to increase the relative runtime of the kernel relative to launch time
- reducing kernel launch time

Reducing the number and complexity kernel parameters reduces the kernel launch latency. In addition:
- field args incur less launch latency than ndarray args
- global fields incur no parameter-related launch latency

For the underlying execution model - what a launch actually involves, where the latency comes from, and when reducing it helps - see [Performance](performance.md).

## Global memory

In CUDA, there are 3 main types of memory:
- registers: fast, but limited in storage capacity
- shared memory: slower than registers, but faster than global. Less limited than registers, but still limited compared to global memory
- global memory: slowest of all. High latency. But massive, typically ~10s of gigabytes at the time of writing

There are some additional types, but these are variations on global memory:
- constant memory: global memory, but which can be stored easily in cache
- local memory: storage which is private to each specific thread, but, unintuitively, is stored off-chip, and is as slow as global memory

Quadrants gives access to shared memory, using `qd.simt.block.SharedArray()`, but typically Quadrants kernels use only global memory and register memory. You cannot directly request to use registers, but registers will be used to hold any local variables, within the limits of available registers. Fields, ndarrays, and other data, are stored in global memory. This holds some implications for synchronization.

## Thread synchronization

Typically, Quadrants kernels use `atomic_` operations for synchronization. This is relatively easy and intuitive, and it works perfectly with global memory. The main downside is that `atomic` operations are slow, because they involve both global memory and thread synchronization, both of which are intrinsically slow, and combining them is slower still.

When using shared memory, there are various barriers and fences that can be used, to ensure that writes from all threads so far have completed, and now threads are free to read from memory written by other threads. The block-level primitives (`qd.simt.block.sync`, `qd.simt.block.mem_fence`, the predicate-reducing barriers, and `SharedArray` itself) are documented in [block](block.md), which also discusses the important distinction between a thread-converging barrier and a memory-only fence.

However, these block-scope fences and barriers do not work for synchronizing writes across blocks. For cross-block coordination through global memory, use `qd.simt.grid.mem_fence()` (a device-scope fence; see [grid](grid.md)) — or, if you need full cross-block thread synchronization, finish the current kernel and launch a new kernel.

## Avoiding synchronization

If there is a way of partitioning data such that no thread ever needs to read data written by another thread, then there is no need for synchronization.

## Maximizing GPU core utilization

A 4090 GPU has ~16,000 cores. A 5090 GPU has ~20,000 cores. In Quadrants, the top level for loop is parallelized over gpu threads:

```python
@qd.kernel
def k1() -> None:
    for i_b in range(B):  # parallelized across B GPU threads
        # work done by each thread
```

In order to maximize the efficient usage of the GPU we want to ensure that as many cores are being used as possible. This means that ideally `B` should be at least the number of cores in the GPU.

## Is it better to put everything in one single for-loop, or to split into multiple top-level loops?

In order to ensure that the kernel runtime is longer than the kernel launch time, we want to do as much work as possible in each kernel launch. This implies fewer kernel launches, that each do more.

However, we might need to break into multiple launches in order to synchronize writes to global memory.

## Compromise

The recommendations above often are self-conflicting. For example, maximizing the number of cores being used might require using atomics for synchronization, which might make the kernels slower. Reducing kernel launches similarly might require using atomics, which would make the kernels run more slowly. So it will not in general be possible to satisfy all the above guidelines. But, it's useful to be aware of the design choices above, and strive to achieve them. Exact choices for best performance will often be an empirical question.

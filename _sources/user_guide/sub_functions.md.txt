# Sub-functions

A `@qd.kernel` can call other functions, as long as those functions are annotated with `@qd.func`.

## qd.func

`@qd.func` is the standard annotation for a function that can be called from a kernel. `@qd.func` functions can also call other `@qd.func` functions.

`@qd.func` is **inlined** into the calling kernel at compile time. This means:
- There is no function call overhead
- The compiler can optimize across the call boundary
- Recursive calls are not supported

```python
@qd.func
def add(a: qd.i32, b: qd.i32) -> qd.i32:
    return a + b

@qd.kernel
def compute(a: qd.Template) -> None:
    for i in range(10):
        a[i] = add(i, 1)
```

### Passing fields and ndarrays

Fields and ndarrays can be passed to `@qd.func` functions:

```python
@qd.func
def increment(arr: qd.Template, idx: qd.i32) -> None:
    arr[idx] += 1

@qd.kernel
def compute(a: qd.Template) -> None:
    for i in range(10):
        increment(a, i)
```

## Restricting a func to the top level (`requires_top_level=True`)

**Experimental.** `requires_top_level` is an experimental feature and its behavior or API may change in a future release.

Some qd.func contain for-loops that are assumed and intended to be top-level for-loops, that each become separate offloaded tasks, and ultimately separate device kernels. If such qd.func's are placed inside other for-loops, the qd.func will no longer generate the structure of offloaded tasks and device kernels assumed, and might either run very slowly, or crash, or give incorrect results.

To enforce that a qd.func can only be used at top-level, a `qd.func` maybe be annotated with `qd.func(requires_top_level=True)`. This will throws `QuadrantsSyntaxError` at compile time if the `qd.func` is not called from top level.

```python
@qd.func(requires_top_level=True)
def op(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32) -> None:
    for i in range(n):  # one of several top-level phase loops
        arr[i] = arr[i] + 1
```

The check is purely compile-time — it adds no runtime or GPU cost, and a correctly placed call compiles to exactly the same code as an unmarked func.

What counts as **top level** (allowed):

- Directly in the kernel body.
- Inside a `qd.static(...)` loop — these are unrolled at compile time, so the calls land at top level (see [static](static.md)).
- Directly inside a `while qd.graph_do_while(...):` body (see [graphs](graph.md)).

What is **rejected**: nesting the call inside a runtime `for`, `if`, or `while`.

```python
@qd.kernel
def good(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32) -> None:
    op(arr, n)                  # OK: top level

@qd.kernel
def also_good(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32) -> None:
    for _ in qd.static(range(2)):
        op(arr, n)              # OK: qd.static is compile-time

@qd.kernel
def bad(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32, flag: qd.i32) -> None:
    if flag > 0:
        op(arr, n)              # QuadrantsSyntaxError raised at compile time
```

The check applies **transitively**. Because `@qd.func` bodies are inlined into the caller, reaching a `requires_top_level=True` func through an intermediate ordinary `@qd.func` is treated exactly as if the call were written inline at that point. So calling it through a helper that sits at the top level is allowed, while calling it through a helper that is itself nested in a runtime `for` / `if` / `while` is rejected.

```python
@qd.func
def helper(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32) -> None:
    op(arr, n)                  # `op` is requires_top_level=True

@qd.kernel
def good_helper(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32) -> None:
    helper(arr, n)              # OK: helper is at the kernel top level

@qd.kernel
def bad_helper(arr: qd.Template, n: qd.i32, flag: qd.i32) -> None:
    if flag > 0:
        helper(arr, n)          # QuadrantsSyntaxError: op is transitively nested in a runtime if
```

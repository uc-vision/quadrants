# Block primitives

Block-level primitives operate on the threads of a single CUDA thread block (CTA) / AMDGPU workgroup / Vulkan or Metal workgroup. They include thread barriers, memory fences, shared memory, and per-thread indexing helpers - the building blocks for cooperation among threads of the same block.

Block ops live under `qd.simt.block`. They are written so the same Python source compiles to the right vendor primitive on each backend. As of this writing every op on this page is portable across CUDA, AMDGPU, Vulkan, and Metal; the only remaining caveat (called out in the support-table footnote below) is a perf trade-off for the emulated `block.sync_*_nonzero` ops on non-CUDA backends, not a correctness gap. If a future op is added that is not yet portable, the Python layer will raise `ValueError` at compile time on the unsupported backend.

The closely-related device-scope memory fence is documented separately in [grid](grid.md). Users picking between a block-scope and a device-scope fence should read that page for the device-scope side.

Vulkan and Metal share a SPIR-V codegen path (Metal goes through MoltenVK → MSL); they are listed as separate columns because a couple of ops have Metal-specific caveats called out below. Footnoted entries are still functional, just with the limitations the footnote describes.

\* On AMDGPU, Vulkan, and Metal the `block.sync_{all,any,count}_nonzero(p)` ops are *emulated* via shared memory (one shared `i32` slot + 2 block barriers + a single `atomic_add` per contributing thread) rather than a single hardware-fused barrier-with-reduction. CUDA has the fused NVPTX `barrier.cta.red.{and,or,popc}.aligned.all.sync` family of intrinsics so it stays on the fast path; the other backends do not have a direct analog (in particular, SPIR-V `OpGroupNonUniform*` only operates at subgroup scope reliably across Vulkan + Metal). All three reductions are routed through `atomic_add` rather than `atomic_or` / `atomic_and`: the latter trip a Metal-specific bug where `OpAtomicOr` on threadgroup memory silently no-ops via MoltenVK / SPIRV-Cross. The emulation is correct and portable but costs two `block.sync()`s plus one shared-memory atomic per call instead of a single barrier instruction; if you have an inner loop calling these ops millions of times, consider whether you can batch the predicate before reducing it.

`block.radix_rank_match_atomic_or` is portable across wave32 (CUDA, Vulkan-on-NVIDIA, Metal) and wave64 (AMDGPU - Quadrants pins every AMDGPU target to `+wavefrontsize64`). The match-mask shared-memory region picks its dtype at compile time: `i32` on wave32 (32-lane ballot fits in a single `i32`, with `subgroup.lanemask_le` and `clz` / `popcnt` on `u32`) and `i64` on wave64 (64-lane ballot needs 64 bits, with an inline u64 `lanemask_le` and `clz` / `popcnt` on `u64`). The two paths share steps 1–4 (per-subgroup histograms, column-sum upsweep, block exclusive scan, downsweep) and step 6 (publish bins + exclusive prefix); only the per-key match phase (step 5) diverges. Atomic `or` on `i64` shared memory is native on AMDGPU LDS; wave32 backends never see the `i64` path, so portability does not depend on SPIR-V / Metal supporting 64-bit threadgroup atomics.

The `block.reduce_*` / `block.reduce_all_*` / `block.inclusive_*` / `block.exclusive_*` ops are `value`-dtype generic - the per-subgroup tree is `subgroup.shuffle*` of `value` and the inter-subgroup staging slot is `block.SharedArray(..., dtype)`, so any scalar dtype Quadrants supports for buffer / kernel I/O on the active backend is accepted. Practically that is `i32` / `i64` / `u32` / `u64` / `f32` / `f64` on CUDA, AMDGPU, and Vulkan-on-Linux; Metal and MoltenVK on Darwin do not support `i64` / `u64` / `f64` through their MSL/SPIR-V buffer paths, so kernels using those dtypes won't compile there. Note also that none of the reduce / scan ops use `atomic_min` / `atomic_max` on floats (which would fall back to a CAS loop on every backend) - they reduce via `shuffle*` + per-thread folds in shared memory only.

Naming note: `block.mem_sync()` was recently renamed to `block.mem_fence()` for consistency with the project's "fence vs barrier" terminology. The old name is still available as a deprecated alias that emits `DeprecationWarning` on first use; new code should use `block.mem_fence()`.

## Barrier vs fence: the distinction that matters

Two of these ops sound similar but have very different semantics, and mixing them up deadlocks the GPU. The summary:

- `block.sync()` is a **thread-converging barrier**. Every thread in the block must reach the call site before any thread proceeds. It also implies a memory fence at block scope.
- `block.mem_fence()` is a **memory fence only**, at block scope. It orders memory operations but does not require thread convergence - it is safe to call from divergent control flow (e.g. inside `if tid == 0`).

Concretely:

- CUDA: `sync()` lowers to `__syncthreads()`; `mem_fence()` lowers to `__threadfence_block()` (a pure fence with no convergence requirement).
- AMDGPU: `sync()` lowers to `s_barrier`; `mem_fence()` lowers to `fence acquire_release syncscope("workgroup")`.
- Vulkan / Metal (SPIR-V): `sync()` lowers to `workgroupBarrier`; `mem_fence()` lowers to `workgroupMemoryBarrier`.

Calling `sync()` from a path that not all threads reach (a divergent `if`, an early `return`, etc.) is a classic GPU deadlock and applies to all backends.

The corresponding distinction at device scope is the grid-scope memory fence (memory fence across the entire grid, no thread synchronization), documented in [grid](grid.md).

## Semantics

### `block.sync()`

A block-wide thread-converging barrier. All threads in the block stop at the call until every thread has reached it; once all have arrived, all proceed. Reads and writes issued before the barrier are visible to other threads in the block after the barrier.

- Lowers to `__syncthreads()` (`nvvm_barrier_cta_sync_aligned_all`) on CUDA, `s_barrier` on AMDGPU, `workgroupBarrier` on SPIR-V.
- Must be called from uniform control flow within the block. Calling from a divergent branch deadlocks.

### `block.sync_all_nonzero(predicate)` / `sync_any_nonzero` / `sync_count_nonzero`

Block-wide barriers that also reduce a per-thread `i32` predicate across the block:

- `sync_all_nonzero(p)` returns non-zero if `p` is non-zero on **every** thread (logical AND).
- `sync_any_nonzero(p)` returns non-zero if `p` is non-zero on **any** thread (logical OR).
- `sync_count_nonzero(p)` returns the number of threads for which `p` is non-zero (popcount).

Each call performs both the synchronization (same convergence requirement as `sync()`) and the reduction.

- On CUDA, this lowers to a single hardware-fused instruction from the NVPTX `barrier.cta.red` family - `block_barrier_and_i32`, `block_barrier_or_i32`, `block_barrier_count_i32`.
- On AMDGPU, Vulkan, and Metal, there is no direct hardware-fused barrier-with-reduction, so the op is emulated in Quadrants Python (`_block_reduce_*_emulated` in `python/quadrants/lang/simt/block.py`) as: lane 0 zeroes a 1-element `SharedArray(i32)` → `block.sync()` → every thread folds its predicate via `qd.atomic_or` / `qd.atomic_add` → `block.sync()` → every thread reads the broadcasted result. Two block barriers plus one shared-memory atomic per call. See the support-table footnote for the perf trade-off.

### `block.mem_fence()`

A block-scope memory fence. Orders memory operations issued by the calling thread so that prior writes are visible to other threads in the block before any subsequent read by the calling thread can be reordered ahead of the fence. It does **not** synchronize threads - no convergence requirement, so it is safe to call from divergent control flow (e.g. inside `if tid == 0`) on every backend.

- Lowers to `__threadfence_block()` (`nvvm_membar_cta`) - the intended target - on CUDA, to an LLVM IR `fence acquire_release syncscope("workgroup")` on AMDGPU (which the AMDGCN backend lowers to the appropriate `s_waitcnt` / cache-flush sequence; emitted via a body-replacement in `llvm_context.cpp` rather than `__builtin_amdgcn_fence`, since the `runtime.cpp` is built with a host-targeted clang that doesn't know AMDGCN builtins), and to `workgroupMemoryBarrier` on SPIR-V (Vulkan / Metal).
- Use this when one thread in the block needs to publish data to shared memory and have other threads observe it via polling, without going through a thread-converging barrier. The canonical pattern is a flag-published producer + spin-waiting consumers:

  ```python
  if tid == 0:
      shared[...] = computed_value
      qd.simt.block.mem_fence()  # order the data write before the flag store
      shared_flag[0] = 1
  else:
      while shared_flag[0] == 0:
          pass
      use(shared[...])  # without the fence above, may observe stale shared[...]
  ```

  `block.sync()` does not work here - it deadlocks, because `tid == 0` and the other threads take divergent paths and never converge at a single call site. `block.sync()` would also be sufficient by itself (it implies a block-scope fence) when the producer and consumers *can* converge; reach for `block.mem_fence()` specifically when they cannot.

The deprecated alias `block.mem_sync()` calls `block.mem_fence()` and emits a `DeprecationWarning` on first use.

### `block.SharedArray(shape, dtype)`

Allocates a shared-memory array, scoped to the calling block.

- `shape`: an `int` (1-D) or a `tuple` / `list` of `int`s (multi-dim). Must be compile-time constants - shared memory is statically allocated per block.
- `dtype`: a scalar Quadrants dtype (`qd.f32`, `qd.i32`, ...) or a `qd.types.matrix(...)` / `qd.types.vector(...)` type. Matrix types are flattened to their element tensor type.

Element access uses the standard `arr[i]` / `arr[i, j]` subscript syntax inside a kernel.

A worked example with `Tile16x16` interaction is in [tile](tile.md).

### `block.global_thread_idx()`

Returns the global thread index of the calling thread within the kernel launch.

On CUDA / AMDGPU this lowers to the in-block thread index (`nvvm_read_ptx_sreg_tid_x` / `amdgcn_workitem_id_x`) plus the grid offset that the offload framework adds; on Vulkan / Metal it lowers to `globalInvocationId` (MoltenVK maps this to MSL `thread_position_in_grid`).

On CUDA / AMDGPU this is the natural way to identify which work-item a thread should process when the kernel uses `qd.loop_config(block_dim=...)` - together with `block_dim`, you can recover the in-block thread index via `global_thread_idx() % block_dim`.

### `block.thread_idx()`

Returns the in-block (workgroup-local) thread index of the calling thread. Available on every supported GPU backend.

- CUDA: `nvvm_read_ptx_sreg_tid_x` (i.e. `threadIdx.x`).
- AMDGPU: `amdgcn_workitem_id_x`.
- Vulkan: `localInvocationId` (`gl_LocalInvocationID.x`).
- Metal: same SPIR-V op as Vulkan; MoltenVK / SPIRV-Cross translates to MSL `thread_position_in_threadgroup`.

This is the thread's index *within its own block / workgroup*. To get the across-grid index, use `block.global_thread_idx()`. The historical workaround on CUDA / AMDGPU of recovering the in-block index via `global_thread_idx() % block_dim` is still valid but no longer necessary; prefer the direct `block.thread_idx()` call for clarity.

Today only the X dimension is exposed (1-D blocks). For 2-D / 3-D blocks the calling code should compute the linear index from `block.thread_idx()` and the block-Y / Z dimensions itself, or stick to 1-D blocks (the dominant Quadrants idiom - `qd.loop_config(block_dim=N)` always sets the X extent).

### `block.reduce_{add,min,max}(value, block_dim, dtype)`

Block-scope reductions following the standard two-stage subgroup-reduction strategy: each subgroup reduces its lanes via a `shuffle_down` tree, lane 0 of each subgroup publishes the subgroup aggregate to shared memory, then thread 0 sequentially folds the subgroup aggregates with the same operator. The result is valid in **thread 0 only**; other threads retain partial values. For the broadcast-to-every-thread variants see `block.reduce_all_{add,min,max}` below.

Arguments:

- `value`: per-thread input.
- `block_dim`: threads per block (compile-time `template()`). Must be a positive multiple of `subgroup.group_size()`, which resolves to 32 on CUDA / Metal / Vulkan-on-NVIDIA and 64 on AMDGPU. Passing a `block_dim` that is not a multiple of the subgroup size raises a compile-time error.
- `dtype`: scalar dtype for the inter-subgroup shared-memory staging slot; must match `value`'s type.

The calling thread's block-local index is read internally via `block.thread_idx()`; the subgroup size is read from `subgroup.group_size()` at compile time. Neither is plumbed through as an argument.

Cost: `log2(subgroup_size)` shuffles + 1 shared-memory write/read per subgroup + 1 `block.sync()` + `(block_dim / subgroup_size) - 1` ops on thread 0. When the block is exactly one subgroup the shared-memory path is short-circuited at compile time.

```python
@qd.kernel
def kern(src: qd.types.ndarray(ndim=1), out: qd.types.ndarray(ndim=1)):
    qd.loop_config(block_dim=128)
    for i in range(N):
        agg = qd.simt.block.reduce_add(src[i], 128, qd.f32)
        if qd.simt.block.thread_idx() == 0:
            out[i // 128] = agg
```

A generic `block.reduce(value, block_dim, op, dtype)` is also available for custom associative operators (e.g. bitwise ops, custom monoids). It accepts an `op: template()` `@qd.func` taking `(a, b)` and returning the same type as `value`.

### `block.reduce_all_{add,min,max}(value, block_dim, dtype)`

The broadcast variants of the above. Identical semantics, but the result is published to a one-slot `SharedArray` and read back by every thread after a second `block.sync()`. Use this when downstream code on every thread needs the block-wide aggregate (e.g. normalizing each thread's value by the block sum). Cost: one extra `block.sync()` plus one shared-memory hop vs. the lane-0-only variants. The corresponding generic form is `block.reduce_all(value, block_dim, op, dtype)`.

### `block.inclusive_{add,min,max}(value, block_dim, dtype)`

Block-scope inclusive prefix scans via the standard two-stage subgroup-scan strategy: each subgroup does a Hillis-Steele scan via `subgroup` shuffles, the last lane of each subgroup publishes the subgroup aggregate to shared memory, then every thread sequentially folds the cross-subgroup prefix and applies its own subgroup's prefix to its scan value. **All threads receive a valid result.** After the call, thread `i` holds `op(v[0], v[1], ..., v[i])`.

Args match `block.reduce_add` (`value, block_dim, dtype`). Cost: per-subgroup Hillis-Steele tree (`log2(subgroup_size)` shuffles) + 1 shared-memory write/read per subgroup + 1 `block.sync()` + `(block_dim / subgroup_size) - 1` ops on every thread (the cross-subgroup prefix is computed redundantly to avoid a second barrier). When the block is exactly one subgroup the shared-memory path is short-circuited at compile time.

```python
@qd.kernel
def kern(src: qd.types.ndarray(ndim=1), out: qd.types.ndarray(ndim=1)):
    qd.loop_config(block_dim=128)
    for i in range(N):
        out[i] = qd.simt.block.inclusive_add(src[i], 128, qd.i32)
```

The corresponding generic form is `block.inclusive_scan(value, block_dim, op, dtype)` for custom monoids.

### `block.exclusive_{add,min,max}(value, block_dim, dtype)`

Block-scope exclusive prefix scans. Same strategy and cost profile as `inclusive_*`, but each thread receives the prefix `op(v[0], ..., v[i-1])` instead - and thread 0 receives the operator's identity, derived at compile time from `value`'s dtype:

- `exclusive_add`: identity is the additive zero, built as `value - value` inside the body. After the call, thread 0 holds `0` in `value`'s dtype.
- `exclusive_min`: identity is `+inf` for real dtypes, `np.iinfo(dtype).max` for integer dtypes (`UINT_MAX` for unsigned, `INT_MAX` for signed). Thread 0 holds this sentinel.
- `exclusive_max`: identity is `-inf` for real dtypes, `np.iinfo(dtype).min` for signed integer dtypes, `0` for unsigned and bool. Thread 0 holds this sentinel.

Mirrors the corresponding `subgroup.exclusive_{min,max}` API: callers no longer pass `identity` for the typed wrappers. Internally `exclusive_min` / `exclusive_max` are plain Python wrappers that introspect the dtype, emit a typed-constant identity Expr, and forward to the generic block scan; the generated IR is identical to the prior hand-supplied form.

The corresponding generic form is `block.exclusive_scan(value, block_dim, op, identity, dtype)`, which still requires an explicit `identity` because the operator can be any custom monoid (no portable type-extreme to introspect for arbitrary ops).

### `block.radix_rank_match_atomic_or(key, block_dim, radix_bits, bit_start, num_bits, bins, excl_prefix)`

Block-level radix ranking via the atomic-OR match-and-count strategy (the workhorse of an SM90-style onesweep radix sort). Each thread holds one `u32` key; the function returns the key's stable rank within the block under the digit `(key >> bit_start) & ((1 << num_bits) - 1)`, and writes the per-digit count and exclusive-prefix arrays to two caller-supplied `block.SharedArray` outparams.

Constraints (currently):

- `block_dim` must equal `1 << radix_bits` (each digit gets exactly one thread for the per-thread bin / exclusive-prefix output). Typical configuration is `radix_bits=8, block_dim=256`.
- `subgroup.group_size()` must be 32 (CUDA / Metal / Vulkan-on-NVIDIA) or 64 (AMDGPU). The match path picks its ballot dtype at compile time - `i32` on wave32, `i64` on wave64 - and the function `static_assert`s this at compile time.
- One key per thread (`items_per_thread = 1`). Multi-item per thread is a future extension.
- `num_bits <= radix_bits`; `bit_start` is the offset of the digit's low bit.

Args:

- `key`: per-thread `u32` input.
- `block_dim`, `radix_bits`, `bit_start`, `num_bits`: all compile-time `template()`.
- `bins`: `block.SharedArray((1 << radix_bits,), qd.i32)`. After the call, `bins[d]` holds the count of keys whose digit equals `d`.
- `excl_prefix`: `block.SharedArray((1 << radix_bits,), qd.i32)`. After the call, `excl_prefix[d]` holds the exclusive prefix sum of `bins` up to digit `d`.

The calling thread's block-local index is read internally via `block.thread_idx()`.

Cost: 2 `block.sync()` + a handful of `subgroup.sync()` calls + 1 block exclusive scan + per-key `atomic_or` + leader-only `atomic_add` on shared memory. Shared-memory footprint at the default `radix_bits=8` configuration: 4 KiB `i32` for the per-subgroup offsets + a match-mask region whose dtype is wave-size-specific - 4 KiB `i32` on wave32 (8 subgroups × 256 digits × 4 B) or 8 KiB `i64` on wave64 (4 subgroups × 256 digits × 8 B). So 8 KiB total on wave32, 12 KiB total on wave64.

```python
@qd.kernel
def kern(keys_in: qd.types.ndarray(ndim=1), ranks_out: qd.types.ndarray(ndim=1)):
    qd.loop_config(block_dim=256)
    for i in range(256):
        bins = qd.simt.block.SharedArray((256,), qd.i32)
        excl = qd.simt.block.SharedArray((256,), qd.i32)
        ranks_out[i] = qd.simt.block.radix_rank_match_atomic_or(
            keys_in[i], 256, 8, 0, 8, bins, excl
        )
```

The function inserts the necessary `block.sync()` retires before returning, so callers can read `bins` / `excl_prefix` immediately after the call without an extra barrier.

# Troubleshooting

## In case of crash/seg fault

- run without cache - or clear cache - to see if this resolves the issue
- if running without cache solves the seg fault, then clear the cache

To run without cache:
```python
qd.init(offline_cache=False, ...)
```

See [qd.init options](init_options.md) for what `offline_cache=False` actually does on CUDA (it bypasses both the Quadrants PtxCache and the NVIDIA driver compute cache).

To clear cache:
- the cache is located by default on linux and mac at `~/.cache/quadrants`
- simply remove this entire folder:
```bash
rm -Rf ~/.cache/quadrants
```

If this doesn't solve the problem, then you'll likely need to log a github issue, providing
as much information as possible, and crucially a minimum reproducible example, to reproduce
the seg fault.

# Supported systems

## CI Tested systems

We test the following systems in our CI servers:
- Python 3.10-Python 3.13
- Mac OS X 14 and 15
- Ubuntu 22.04 and Ubuntu 24.04
- Windows Server 2025

## Supported systems:

### Operating systems
- Mac Silicon 14 or 15
- Ubuntu 22.04 and 24.04 (x64 and ARM64)
- Windows 10 or later (x86 only)

### GPUs

- CUDA GPUs, `sm_60` (Pascal) through `sm_120` (Blackwell / Thor) — i.e. `>=sm_60` and `<=sm_120`
- Metal GPUs
- AMD GPUs
- Vulkan-compatible GPUs (e.g. Intel Arc)

If you have a newer NVIDIA GPU (above `sm_120`), please [open an issue on the Quadrants repo](https://github.com/Genesis-Embodied-AI/quadrants/issues).

### Backend / OS matrix

Which backends are available on each supported platform. `qd.cpu` and `qd.vulkan` run on every OS; the other GPU backends are platform-specific because they wrap vendor drivers (CUDA on NVIDIA, ROCm on AMD, Metal on Apple).

| OS \ backend | `qd.cpu` | `qd.cuda` | `qd.amdgpu` | `qd.metal` | `qd.vulkan` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | yes | n/a | n/a | yes | yes |
| Linux x64 | yes | yes | yes | n/a | yes |
| Linux ARM64 | yes | no | no | n/a | yes |
| Windows x86 | yes | yes | no | n/a | yes |
| Windows ARM64 | yes | no | no | n/a | yes |

Notes:
- `qd.cuda` requires an NVIDIA driver and CUDA runtime installed on the host. NVIDIA ships CUDA for Linux ARM64 and Windows ARM64, but quadrants does not support them yet.
- `qd.amdgpu` currently wires up the Linux x64 ROCm path only. AMD's GPU toolchain also ships on Windows and on some Linux ARM64 targets, but quadrants does not support them yet. On AMD GPUs, a subgroup is always 64 threads wide, so [`qd.simt.subgroup`](./subgroup.md) primitives operate over 64 lanes on both CDNA (Instinct) and RDNA (Radeon) hardware.
- `qd.metal` is only available on Apple hardware and is the recommended GPU backend there.
- `qd.vulkan` on macOS bundles a copy of MoltenVK (a Vulkan-to-Metal translation layer) inside the wheel, so no separate install is required.

### Python backend

A pure-Python backend (`qd.python`) is available on any system where PyTorch is installed. See [Python backend](./python_backend.md).

# Matrix and Vector

Quadrants provides `qd.Matrix` and `qd.Vector` types for small, fixed-size linear algebra inside kernels. These are stored in GPU registers and are unrolled at compile time, so they are fast — but should be kept small for best performance (more than 144 elements total — i.e. larger than 12×12 — will trigger a warning).

`qd.Vector` is a special case of `qd.Matrix` with one column.

## Creating vectors and matrices in kernels

```python
@qd.kernel
def compute() -> None:
    v = qd.Vector([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
    m = qd.Matrix([[1.0, 0.0], [0.0, 1.0]])

    # Access elements
    x = v[0]          # 1.0
    val = m[0, 1]     # 0.0
```

## Vector and matrix fields

To store many vectors or matrices, use vector/matrix fields:

```python
import quadrants as qd

qd.init(arch=qd.gpu)

# first define the type
vec3f = qd.types.vector(3, qd.f32)

# A field of 100 3D vectors
positions = qd.field(vec3f, shape=(100,))

# or for ndarray
positions = qd.ndarray(vec3f, shape=(100,))

# first define the type
mat3f = qd.types.matrix(3, 3, qd.f32)

# A field of 100 3x3 matrices
rotations = qd.field(mat3f, shape=(100,))

# or for ndarray
rotations = qd.ndarray(mat3f, shape=(100,))

@qd.kernel
def initialize(pos: qd.Template, rot: qd.Template) -> None:
    for i in range(100):
        pos[i] = qd.Vector([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])
        rot[i] = qd.Matrix.diag(3, 1.0)  # identity matrix

initialize(positions, rotations)
```

## Vector and matrix ndarrays

```python
# An ndarray of 50 3D vectors
vel = qd.Vector.ndarray(3, qd.f32, shape=(50,))

# An ndarray of 50 4x4 matrices
transforms = qd.Matrix.ndarray(4, 4, qd.f32, shape=(50,))
```

## Type annotations

For kernel and `@qd.func` parameters, use `qd.types.vector` and `qd.types.matrix`:

```python
vec3f = qd.types.vector(3, qd.f32)
mat3f = qd.types.matrix(3, 3, qd.f32)

@qd.kernel
def transform(
    positions: qd.types.NDArray[vec3f, 1],
    matrices: qd.types.NDArray[mat3f, 1],
    out: qd.types.NDArray[vec3f, 1],
) -> None:
    for i in range(100):
        out[i] = matrices[i] @ positions[i]
```

## Operations

Element-wise arithmetic, dot / cross / outer products, norms, transpose / determinant / trace / inverse, Frobenius inner product, and matrix-vector / matrix-matrix multiply all live on a separate page since they all run **per thread, in registers, with no cross-thread cooperation**. See [matrix_vector_per_thread](matrix_vector_per_thread.md).

For per-thread *numerical* algorithms (SVD, symmetric eigendecomposition, polar decomposition, linear solve) see [linalg_per_thread](linalg_per_thread.md).

For cross-thread / sparse linear algebra (CG, sparse direct solvers) see `qd.linalg.*` (separate, not yet covered in user guide).

## Size limit

Matrices and vectors are unrolled into scalar registers at compile time. Using more than 144 elements (i.e. larger than 12×12) will trigger a warning and may cause very long compile times. For larger matrices, use a field instead:

```python
large = qd.field(qd.f32, shape=(64, 64))
```

The 144-element threshold is set by the largest size officially supported by the per-thread linalg APIs (`Matrix.inverse` up to 12×12; `qd.sym_eig` and `qd.make_spd` cap lower, at 6×6) — those internal constructions stay below the warning threshold.

## Storage layout: packed vs unpacked vectors

`qd.types.vector(N, dtype)` accepts an optional `unpacked: bool = False` kwarg that controls how the vector is laid out in per-thread memory when used as a `@qd.dataclass` field. The kwarg does not affect the *value type* — the field still holds a vector — it only affects the storage layout.

- `unpacked=False` (default): the field is stored as a single group of `N` scalars. The compiler keeps the whole vector in registers, or, if there is insufficient register storage, spills the whole vector to "local" memory (which despite the name lives in off-chip DRAM and is slow). It is all-or-nothing per vector.
- `unpacked=True`: the field is stored as `N` independent scalar slots. The compiler can decide per slot whether to keep it in a register or spill it. Under register pressure this can be the difference between "most of the vector still lives in registers" and "the entire vector is in DRAM".

```python
@qd.dataclass
class Tile:
    r: qd.types.vector(32, qd.f32, unpacked=True)
```

The flag is consumed at class-definition time. `@qd.dataclass` expands the field into `N` synthetic scalar members `_r0.._r{N-1}`, and each `obj.r[i]` (for python-int / `qd.static`-resolved `i`) is lowered to a direct reference to the i-th synthetic member. The generated LLVM IR / PTX is byte-identical to declaring `N` named scalar fields by hand (`r0: qd.f32`, `r1: qd.f32`, ...), but the source keeps the indexed read/write syntax.

### When to choose `unpacked=True` vs `unpacked=False`

Generally, the trade-off is compile time vs runtime, assuming you don't need any of the plethora of functionalities that packed offers you (see the table above). The target use-case that unpacked was built for was holding a tile of size 16x16 or 32x32, in a warp of threads, where each thread in the warp holds a single row of 16 or 32 values. In this case, the size of each row is pre-determined (either 16 or 32, templated), which meets one pre-requisite of using unpacked. We want all values to ideally be stored in registers. However, when we start holding multiple 32x32 tiles in a warp, we found that we were spilling entire 32-length vectors into local memory, causing very noticeable slowdowns. Migrating to use hand-coded scalars, instead of vectors, was faster, but painful to write, and very slow to compile. Using unpacked vectors is as fast as hand-coded scalars, but faster to compile.

In such a scenario, we prefer to use for loops, to avoid having to unroll for-loops by hand. But we can use static for loops, satisfying the condition of only ever indexing with python int or qd.static resolved values. i.e. something like:

```
    for i in qd.static(range(32)):
        # Do something with tile.r[i], where tile is the qd.dataclass, and tile.r is the unpacked vector.
```

We can then see the runtime/compile time trade-off because:
- static unrolled loops increase compile time
- using unpacked vectors increases compile time, compared to packed vectors

However:
- static unrolled loops, and unpacked vectors run much faster at runtime
- the compile time of unpacked vectors is still much faster than hand coded scalars

The issue with hand coded scalars is that you either have to literally hand-code everything, or you end up writing convenience functions like:

```
def get_r(i):
    if i == 0:
        return tile.r0
    if i == 1:
        return tile.r1
    ...
```

Such functions cause heavy IR bloat, and slow down runtime considerably, and/or slow down compile time too, depending on exact implementation choices made.

Using unpacked vector gives:
- compact code => easy to maintain
- fast runtime code
- fast compile time (relative to certain hand-coded approaches).

### Constraints

- **Only valid as a `@qd.dataclass` field annotation.** The `unpacked=True` flag is consumed by `@qd.dataclass`. Attempting to instantiate the type as a value (`T(...)`, `T.field(...)`, `T.ndarray(...)`), use it as a kernel-arg / `@qd.func` parameter type, or apply it on a `@dataclasses.dataclass` raises `QuadrantsSyntaxError`. If you need a value type, drop `unpacked=True`.
- **Indexed access only.** The supported pattern is `obj.r[i]` for python-int / `qd.static`-resolved `i`. Operations that treat `obj.r` itself as a vector value — vector arithmetic, reductions, swizzle, runtime indexing, passing the field across a `@qd.func` boundary, copying into shared memory as a unit — are not supported on an unpacked field today, even though the value type is a vector. If you need any of those, use plain `qd.types.vector(N, dtype)`.
- **Synthetic field-name collisions are rejected.** The expansion uses the convention `_{group_name}{i}` (e.g. `_r0`, `_r1`, ..., `_r31`). Declaring your own field with one of those names raises `QuadrantsSyntaxError` at class-decoration time.

### Mixing with other fields

`unpacked=True` fields compose with anything else allowed on `@qd.dataclass`: scalars, plain vectors, matrices, other unpacked vectors, nested dataclasses.

```python
@qd.dataclass
class TwoTiles:
    a: qd.types.vector(32, qd.f32, unpacked=True)
    b: qd.types.vector(32, qd.f32, unpacked=True)
    scale: qd.f32
```

The generated struct in this example has 65 scalar members (`_a0..._a31`, `_b0..._b31`, `scale`).

# Advanced

## How the packed vs unpacked layout differs at the LLVM level

A plain `qd.types.vector(N, dtype)` field on a `@qd.dataclass` lowers to a single stack-allocated group of `N` packed scalars. LLVM's optimizer attempts to decompose that group into `N` per-slot register-resident values, but the decomposition is conservative: under high register pressure (e.g. two concurrent 32×32 tiles in a Cholesky + triangular solve) the optimizer bails out and the whole vector spills to local memory as a unit.

`qd.types.vector(N, dtype, unpacked=True)` expands to `N` independent scalar stack slots, one per element, so the optimizer can promote each slot to a register independently and the register allocator can spill only the slots it has to. That is exactly what the hand-rolled `r0..r{N-1}` form produces; the generated LLVM IR / PTX matches it byte-for-byte.

## How to check for spills

Quadrants compiles LLVM -> PTX directly via the LLVM NVPTX target — it does not invoke `nvcc` / `ptxas` at compile time, so the familiar `ptxas --verbose` "X bytes spill stores" output is not produced inline. To get that diagnostic you dump the PTX from Quadrants and run `ptxas -v` on it yourself. Three workflows, in order of usefulness:

### 1. Dump PTX, run `ptxas -v` offline

```python
qd.init(
    arch=qd.cuda,
    print_kernel_asm=True,    # dump PTX to CWD as quadrants_kernel_nvptx_NNNN.ptx
    offline_cache=False,      # bypass the kernel cache so the dump fires every time
)
```

Run your kernel once. For each `quadrants_kernel_nvptx_NNNN.ptx` file in the working directory:

```bash
ptxas --verbose -arch=sm_86 quadrants_kernel_nvptx_0007.ptx -o /dev/null 2>&1 | grep -E "spill|stack"
```

Sample output:

```
ptxas info    : Used 64 registers, 0 bytes spill stores, 0 bytes spill loads
ptxas info    : Used 96 registers, 384 bytes stack frame, 256 bytes spill stores, 128 bytes spill loads
```

`spill stores` + `spill loads` > 0 means the register allocator gave up on something. `stack frame` > 0 indicates local memory in use (which is usually, but not always, spills — `qd.simt.shared_array` and explicitly addressed locals also count).

Adjust `-arch=sm_XX` to match your GPU (`sm_86` = Ampere consumer / RTX 30, `sm_89` = Ada / RTX 40, `sm_90` = Hopper).

### 2. Inspect the PTX directly for local-memory loads / stores

NVIDIA's PTX assembly uses the mnemonics `ld.local` and `st.local` for loads and stores against per-thread local memory (off-chip DRAM). Any kernel that spills must contain these mnemonics. Grep the dumped PTX for them:

```bash
grep -nE "ld\.local|st\.local" quadrants_kernel_nvptx_0007.ptx | head -20
```

Matches that aren't from deliberate `qd.simt.shared_array` accesses (those use the shared-memory mnemonics `ld.shared` / `st.shared`, not the `.local` ones) are spill traffic.

### 3. Runtime spill counters via Nsight Compute (most authoritative)

```bash
ncu --set full --section MemoryWorkloadAnalysis ./your_program
```

Look at the "Memory Workload Analysis -> Local Memory" section. This reports *actually executed* local-memory loads / stores, which catches issues `ptxas` doesn't (e.g. driver-stage JIT spills on a different GPU, hot-path-only spills that static analysis misses).

### Also useful: post-optimization LLVM IR

```python
qd.init(arch=qd.cuda, print_kernel_llvm_ir_optimized=True)
```

Dumps `quadrants_kernel_cuda_llvm_ir_optimized_NNNN.ll`. In LLVM IR, every per-function stack allocation appears as an `alloca` instruction. The optimizer tries to promote each `alloca` into a register-resident value; any `alloca` that survives the optimizer into the post-optimization dump is a stack slot it couldn't promote, and it will become PTX local memory. Grep for them:

```bash
grep -nE "alloca" quadrants_kernel_cuda_llvm_ir_optimized_0007.ll | head
```

### Gotcha: the offline cache

`print_kernel_asm` and `print_kernel_llvm_ir*` only fire on the first compile per kernel-key. If your kernel is already in the offline cache, the dump won't be regenerated. Either:

- pass `offline_cache=False` to `qd.init` (cleanest), or
- delete the cache (path is printed at `qd.init` time; typically under `~/.cache/quadrants/`).

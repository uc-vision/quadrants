    #
    #   - A multi-axis `qd.ndrange(...)` whose flat loop index is decomposed into per-axis indices via repeated

    #     cannot cover it. The comparison has to resolve the LocalLoad chain (compare `ll->src` to the backup, not
    #     the operand itself or the cursor) because `begin`/`end` are always value-producing stmts, not the alloca,

    # single-thread reducer kernel on CUDA / AMDGPU, compute-shader reducer on SPIR-V), counts threads with `selector[i]
    # > eps`, and sizes the float adstack heap to that count. The lazy LCA-block atomic claim then maps each gated
    # thread to a unique row in `[0, count)`. `ad_stack_size=32` keeps per-stack max_size small so the worst-case heap
    # allocation is much larger than the gated subset actually consumes - amplifying the savings ratio so a regression
    # that breaks the reducer dispatch and silently falls back to worst-case sizing still produces a passing test, while
    # a regression that corrupts the row mapping fails on the gradient oracle. The kernel places the gate immediately
    # above the inner range-for so the LCA pre-pass places the float-LCA inside the gate, the precondition for the
    # bound_expr capture. `n=256` is deliberately larger than a typical CPU worker pool (~8 threads) so the CPU host
    # reducer must walk the full ndarray to count gate-passing iterations, not just the worker-pool prefix; a reducer
    # that walks `[0, num_cpu_threads)` undercounts in the sparse case and aliases every later iteration's claimed row
    # into a single slot. `gated_fraction=0.5` is the tightest catch for that class of bug because the count mismatch

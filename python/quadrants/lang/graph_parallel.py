"""User-facing ``qd.graph.parallel_context`` / ``qd.graph.parallel`` context-managers and their no-op Python-runtime
stubs.

Kept in its own module to keep ``lang/misc.py`` from growing further (mirrors ``checkpoint.py``) -- the AST transformer
and the C++ runtime do all the actual implementation work; this file is just the public API entry point.

Exposed under the canonical ``qd.graph`` namespace as ``qd.graph.parallel_context`` / ``qd.graph.parallel`` (see
``quadrants/lang/graph.py``). Also re-exported via ``qd.lang.misc`` under the deprecated flat names
``qd.graph_parallel_context`` / ``qd.graph_parallel``, which still work but emit a ``DeprecationWarning``.

def graph_parallel_context():
    """Opens a fork/join region whose ``qd.graph.parallel()`` sections run concurrently.

    Used as ``with qd.graph.parallel_context():`` inside a ``@qd.kernel(graph=True)`` kernel. The region's
    body must contain only ``with qd.graph.parallel():`` blocks. Each ``qd.graph.parallel`` section is an
    independent sequence of work; the ``qd.graph.parallel`` sections have no ordering relative to each
    other and may execute concurrently, while everything after the region waits for *all* ``qd.graph.parallel``
    sections to finish (the join). This is the graph analogue of ``qd.stream_parallel()`` (which is for
    non-graph kernels): it lets independent stages -- e.g. qipc's point-triangle and edge-edge assembly
    -- overlap inside a captured graph.

    Concurrency contract (the author's responsibility): ``qd.graph.parallel`` sections must be data-race
    free with respect to one another (no ``qd.graph.parallel`` section reads what another writes, no two
    ``qd.graph.parallel`` sections write the same location). Calls *within* a ``qd.graph.parallel`` section
    keep their program order.

    Backend behavior:
      - CUDA SM graph path: ``qd.graph.parallel`` sections become independent graph chains joined by an
        empty node, so the runtime schedules them on parallel streams (real overlap).
      - CPU / Vulkan / Metal / AMDGPU graph: correct results, ``qd.graph.parallel`` sections run serially
        (the concurrency tags are honored only by the graph builder today).

    Restrictions (enforced at kernel compile time):
      - Must be used inside ``@qd.kernel(graph=True)``.
      - The region body may contain only ``with qd.graph.parallel():`` blocks.
      - Regions cannot be nested, and a ``qd.graph.parallel`` section body must be straight-line task work
        (no nested ``qd.graph.do_while``, ``qd.checkpoint``, or ``qd.graph.parallel_context``).

    This function should not be called directly at runtime; it is recognized and transformed during AST compilation.
    At Python runtime (outside kernels) it is a no-op context manager.

    See also ``docs/source/user_guide/graph.md``.
